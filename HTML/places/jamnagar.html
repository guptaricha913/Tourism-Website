<h1>Jamnagar</h1>
<br><br><p>
Jamnagar the Jewel of Kathiawar, is on the coast of Gulf of Kutch in the state of Gujarat. Until its merger with the Indian Union after independence, Nawanagar was one of more important princely states of Saurastra.<img src="jamnagar.jpg" align="right">It was established by Jam Raval in the 16th c. and ruled by his descendants. The capital was Jamnagar, which now gives the districts its name. Legend associates the area with Krishna, who migrated from Mathura and established his kingdom at Dwarka. The Jams trace their ancestry to Krishna's Yadav clan. During his reign, Jam Ranjitsinhji laid the city out on a western model. He was one of the greatest cricket players in the history of the game, even though he played mainly for England, and drew inspiration from his exposure to Europe.</p>
