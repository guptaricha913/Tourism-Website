<h1>Junagadh</h1>
<br><br>
<p>
Stepped in history, culture, spirituality and religion, Junagadh is the Soul of Saurastra. In just 60 km the terrain descends from Mt Girnar, Gujarat's highest point at 1000 meter, to the Veraval coast. The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is the only remaining habitat of the pure Asiatic Lion. <img src="junagadh.jpg" align="right">The countryside has much to offer but calls for a determined effort to places in veraval-Patan and Junagadh city are a must on the intinerary of the traveler in Saurastra. Junagadh, nestled at the foot of Mt Girnar, is an amazing amalgam of the old and new.It is a relatively small place, where bustling bazaars and winding narrow streets alternate with monuments that span two millennia and civic spaces that must have been gracious before they suffered crowding and encroachment.</p>
